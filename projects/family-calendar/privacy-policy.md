# Family Calendar Sleeps - Kids — Privacy Policy  
_Last updated: **1 May 2025**_

Family Calendar Sleeps - Kids (the “App”) is created by **shohdotdev** (“we,” “us,” or “our”).  
We respect your family’s privacy and are committed to protecting any information you (and your children) provide while using the App.

---

## 1. No Personal Data Collection
- **No account sign‑up.** We do not require you or your child to create an account or supply a name, email address, or any other personal identifier.  
- **No online profile.** All information stays on the device; the App does not transmit or back‑up data to our servers.  
- **COPPA compliance.** Because the App can be used by children under 13, we designed it to operate **without collecting personal information** as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

---

## 2. What Data Is Stored Locally

| Data | Purpose | Storage Method |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Event titles & dates** | Display countdowns and reminders | Stored locally in encrypted Hive database |
| **Premium‑unlock flag** | Remember one‑time purchase | Stored locally in encrypted Hive database |
| **Notification preference** (on/off, hour) | Schedule daily reminders | Stored in system notification settings |

> **We never upload or share this locally stored data.**

---

## 3. Purchases & Payments
The App offers a **one‑time Premium unlock** processed by Apple’s App Store and Google Play.  
We do **not** receive your payment information—transactions are handled exclusively by the respective store.

---

## 4. Notifications
With your permission, the App can send a daily reminder such as “Today is Grandma’s Birthday!”  
Notifications are created and managed entirely on the device using the system’s local‑notification service.  
You can enable or disable reminders at any time in your device settings.

---

## 5. No Third‑Party Ads or Analytics
The App is **ad‑free** and does not include third‑party analytics SDKs.  
We do not use cookies or trackers.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy
Because we intentionally avoid collecting personal information, children can safely use the App without parental consent under COPPA.  
All in‑app dialogs requiring a parent decision (e.g., unlocking Premium, deleting an event) are protected by a simple math challenge.

---

## 7. Security
- Data is stored in a sandboxed application directory inaccessible to other apps.  
- Premium status is validated by the App Store / Play Store at purchase time.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect product or legal changes.  
We will post the new policy date at the top of this page.  
Continued use of the App after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
