<!-- Open Graph for social share -->
<meta property="og:title" content="[Project Name]" />
<meta property="og:description" content="[Project Description]" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:url" content="[Project URL]" />
<meta property="og:image" content="[Project Cover Image URL]" />
```
