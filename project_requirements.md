# Project Homepage Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the essential requirements and best practices for creating project homepages. The design and structure should be adaptable to each project's unique needs while maintaining good web development practices.

## Essential Elements

### 1. Meta Information
```html
<!-- Meta -->
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
<meta name="description" content="[Project Name] – [Brief Description]" />

<!-- Open Graph for social share -->
<meta property="og:title" content="[Project Name]" />
<meta property="og:description" content="[Project Description]" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:url" content="[Project URL]" />
<meta property="og:image" content="[Project Cover Image URL]" />
```

### 2. Core Sections
- Header/Navigation (structure and style can be customized per project)
- Main content area
- Footer (structure and style can be customized per project)

### 3. Content Organization
- Clear information hierarchy
- Logical content flow
- Easy-to-scan sections
- Project-specific sections as needed

### 4. Privacy Policy Requirements
- Each project that collects user data must have a privacy policy
- Privacy policy should be accessible at: `example.com/projects/[appname]/privacy_policy.html`
- Privacy policy should be written in both Markdown and HTML formats
- Privacy policy should include:
  - Last updated date
  - Data collection practices
  - Data storage methods
  - User rights
  - Contact information
  - Compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., COPPA for children's apps)

## File Structure
```

```

## Best Practices
1. Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
2. Use semantic HTML5 elements
3. Implement responsive design
4. Ensure cross-browser compatibility
5. Optimize for performance
6. Follow accessibility guidelines
7. Use clear and meaningful class names
8. Comment code where necessary
